    <h2>Privacy Policy for CodeDash!</h2>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 10, 2025</p>

    <h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
    <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. CodeDash! was designed from the ground up with a "privacy-first" approach.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>In simple terms: CodeDash! is a completely offline application. We do not collect, save, transmit, or share any of your personal or usage data.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>1. No Personal Data Collection</h3>
    <p>We do not ask for or collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location. Creating an account is not required to use the Application.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Is Stored Locally Only</h3>
    <p>All data generated while you play, such as your scores, high scores, game statistics, and unlocked items, is saved <strong>exclusively on your own device</strong>. We use IndexedDB, a standard web technology for storing data within your browser or the application's WebView component. This data never leaves your device and is not sent to us or any third party.</p>

    <h3>3. No Internet Connection Required</h3>
    <p>The Application does not require an internet connection to function. It does not make calls to external servers, does not include advertisements, and does not use any analytics or tracking tools.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Application Permissions</h3>
    <p>CodeDash! does not require any special permissions on your device (such as access to contacts, camera, or location) to operate.</p>

    <h3>5. Deleting Your Data</h3>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally, you have full control over it. To delete all your game data, you can clear the application's data from your device's settings or, if playing in a web browser, clear the site data.</p>
    
    <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>While we do not anticipate changing our privacy-first philosophy, we reserve the right to update this policy in the future. Any changes will be posted here.</p>

    <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us via email: <a href="mailto:support@codedash.top">support@codedash.top</a></p>
